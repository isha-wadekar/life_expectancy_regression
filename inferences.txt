# Import dataset Nations2.dta using package ‘haven’
Code:
library(haven)
data <- read_stata("C:/Users/Isha/Downloads/Nations2.dta")

# Exploratory analysis
1. explore data and its format
Code:
head(data)

2. explore the datatypes of variables
Code:
sapply(data, FUN=class)

3. explore correlation between the variables
Code:
nums <- unlist(lapply(data, is.numeric))
data[ , nums]
cormat <- cor(data[, nums],use='pairwise.complete.obs')
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cormat,type = 'lower')

Inference: 
This graph must be read according to the given color scale. There exists high positive correlation between variable life and school and high negative correlation between variable life and chldmort.

#Running regression taking life expectancy as dependent variable and region, gdp, school, adfert, chldmort, life, pop, urban, femlab, literacy, co2 and gini as independent variables.
1. Running regression and obtaining results
Code:
m1<-lm(life~region+ gdp+ school+ adfert+ chldmort+ pop+ urban+ femlab+ literacy+ co2+ gini,
data=data)
summary(m1)

Inference:
Out of the 12 independent variables, only the following 4 are significant at a p level of 0.05–
• GDP(gdp)
One unit change in GDP will induce a change of 2.768e-04 units in life expectancy at birth (life). The positive coefficient implies that there exists a direct relationship 
between GDP and life expectancy at birth.
• child mortality (chldmort)
One unit change in GDP will induce a change of -0.159 units in life expectancy at birth (life). The negative coefficient implies that there exists an inverse relationship 
between child mortality and life expectancy at birth.
• female/male labor force ratio(femlab)
One unit change in GDP will induce a change of -6.068 units in life expectancy at birth (life). The negative coefficient implies that there exists an inverse relationship 
between female/male labor force ratio and life expectancy at birth.
• tons of CO2 emitted per cap(co2)
One unit change in GDP will induce a change of -0.079 units in life expectancy at birth (life). The negative coefficient implies that there exists an inverse relationship 
between tons of CO2 emitted per cap and life expectancy at birth.

The adjusted R-squared is 0.918 which indicates that 91.86% of the variation in life expectancy at birth (dependent variable) is explained by variation in these 12 
independent variables. This also implies that the model is a very good fit.

The p-value of the regression equation is 2.2e-16, which is very less than the significance level of 0.05. This implies that the model is significant.

2. Plotting the regression of life expectancy against each of the independent variables
Code:
plot(life~region+ gdp+ school+ adfert+ chldmort+ pop+ urban+ femlab+ literacy+ co2+ gini, data=data)
abline(m1)

#Testing for assumptions of linear regression
1. checking heteroscedasticity by plotting residual vs fitted values
Code:
plot(m1$resid~m1$fitted.values)
abline(h=0,lty=2)

Inference: 
The regression satisfies homoscedasticity as there is no pattern observed between residuals and fitted values.

2. checking normality by checking if quantile to quantile plot is diagonal
Code:
qqnorm(m1$resid)
qqline(m1$resid)

Inference: 
The residuals are normal since the fitted line is diagonal.

3. checking for multicollinearity
A] 
Code:
avPlots(m1)

Inference : 
There exists multicollinearity between child mortality and other variables when regressed against life expectancy. Same is the case with female/male labor force.

B] 
Code:
car::vif(m1)

Inference: 
There exists multicollinearity between GDP and life expectancy and co2 and life expectancy as the variance inflating factor (VIF) is greater than 10 in their case.

4. checking linearity
Code:
residualPlots(m1)

Inference: 
The relationship between school and life expectancy, urban and life expectancy, female/male labor force and life expectancy, literacy rate and life expectancy and gini 
coefficient and life expectancy is linear.
